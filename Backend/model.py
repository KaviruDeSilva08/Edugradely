"""## Summary:

### Q&A
Based on the analysis, the model's performance is not satisfactory due to the small dataset.  The model may be overfitting.  To improve the model, acquiring more data, exploring alternative algorithms, and performing more sophisticated feature engineering are recommended.

### Data Analysis Key Findings
* The initial exploratory data analysis revealed a `ValueError` when attempting to calculate correlations due to non-numeric data. Descriptive statistics for the `FinalGrade` column were successfully calculated, with a mean of 69.5 and a standard deviation of 31.75.
* Data cleaning involved handling missing values, cleaning text data (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stop words, and stemming), and removing duplicate rows.  The `FinalGrade` column was converted to numeric.
* Feature engineering generated new features from text analysis: cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance between 'Answer' and 'Rubric' TF-IDF vectors, and answer length.
* Multiple attempts were made to split the data for model training.  Due to the small dataset size, a final 80/20 split without a validation set was used, resulting in very small training and testing sets.
* A Random Forest Regressor model was trained, initially with a train-test split and then on the entire dataset due to poor performance on the test set. The model showed an improved R-squared (R²) of 0.48 when trained on the entire dataset.
* Hyperparameter optimization using `RandomizedSearchCV` was performed, resulting in the best hyperparameters: `{'n_estimators': 50, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_samples_leaf': 4, 'max_depth': None}`.  However, the model still exhibited poor performance on the test set, with a negative R².
* The final model evaluation, performed on the entire dataset, showed an MAE of 22.45, RMSE of 29.86, and R² of 0.017.  These results suggest a weak model fit due to the small dataset size.

### Insights or Next Steps
* The small dataset size significantly limits the model's reliability and generalizability.  Acquiring more data is crucial for improving performance.
* Explore alternative machine learning models or more advanced text analysis techniques to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
